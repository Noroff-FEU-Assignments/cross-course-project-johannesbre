    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">The client should perform the appropriate investigation into potential security threats, in my opinion. By testing and inspecting the HTML, security issues like as SQL injection, XSS attacks, and other threats are looked for. additionally ensuring the security of the data on the page and the exclusivity of its access by authorized users. It would be advisable to put the website on a safe server to improve website security. Hosting on a platform like Netlify, for example, allows access to security, HTTPS, ongoing updates, and more. It is also crucial to obtain an HTTPS certificate since it demonstrates to users that the data being sent and received by the website is encrypted and secure.</p>
